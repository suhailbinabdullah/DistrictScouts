Through these initiatives, young people become agents of positive change who inspire others to take action.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5;"><span style="font-size: 20px;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">&quot;The Mission of Scouting is to contribute to the education of young people, through a value system based on the Scout Promise and Law, to help build a better world where people are self-fulfilled as individuals and play a constructive role in society.&quot; The Mission was adopted at the 35th World Scout Conference in Durban, South Africa in 1999. Illustrating both the local and global impact of Scouting, the Mission of Scouting has been captured in World Scouting&rsquo;s brand as &quot;Creating a Better World&rdquo;.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
